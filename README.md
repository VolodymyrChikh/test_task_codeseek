Postman-collection file contains some GET request to check some info like teams, players etc. There is the only POST endpoint that transfers player from one team to another. 
The project is filled up with data automatically, you just need to create "football_manager_db"(application.yml file) database. So you can check it with GET endpoints and then trasfer player.
